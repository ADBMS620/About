### About The Course: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms

<ChatBaseBubble/>

This course provides fundamentals for students with the necessary skills. The first half of the course focuses on providing students with basic data structures, sorting algorithms, complexity analysis and basically foundations of data structures and then we provide advanced data structures techniques including Hashing techniques, Heaps, binary search trees and its applications.The second half of the course focuses on algorithmic thinking and different types of graph algorithms, greedy algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms, greedy strategy and principles and applications, some classic problems of dynamic programming. Also we provide some advanced topics such as Np- completeness, approximation algorithms and gradient descent algorithm.

## Instructional Methods and Expectations

The course will be run using a project-based and flipped-classroom strategy. Students are expected to do pre-class activities before coming to class. In-class hours are used to discuss and solve problems as well as to do projects.

Students are expected to do their pre-reading and homework on their own while discussing the cohort sessions and projects with the instructors in class. There will be hands-on programming activities for all cohort sessions.
